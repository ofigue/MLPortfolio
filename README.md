# Projects:

## [Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table](https://github.com/ofigue/Tazmania_WaterPump)

This project is based on the competition Driven Data published related to an earthquake [1] that took place at Nepal on April 2015. In this proyect it is analysed the elements that eventually affect the degree of damage that a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, can cause. Then predictive models had been built in order to approximate a precise solution, which is measured with the performance metric required for the problem. To run the project, refer to the end of README.md file.
